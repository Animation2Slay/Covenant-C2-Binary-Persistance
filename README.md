# Covenant-C2-Binary-Persistance
This is a short script that I made. It disguises itself as an asset loader for a game (which actually does launch), but secretly fully disables Windows Defender, runs the Covenant C2 Binary exe in minimized mode, adds some stuff to startup which will then run the script all over again (but shorter) and makes the exe file a system file!
